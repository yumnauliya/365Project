# Day 002 – Setting Up

What I did:
- Setup c++ in vs code
- Created C++ template project for VS Code

What I learned:
- Template project : IDE convenience, not C++ requirement 
- `.exe`           : Compiled binary output              
- Any name works   : Filename ≠ program logic             
- `.\` needed      : Windows execution rule               
- C++20 needed     : `<=>` operator requirement           


Time spent:
- 140 minutes
