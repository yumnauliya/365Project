# Day 003 – First Program

What I did:
- Tried my first program

What I learned:
- Learned the usage of return 0
- main() returns a value to the operating system
- return 0; means success
- The return value is called an exit code
- In C++, return 0; in main() is optional
- return 0; does NOT do cleanup by itself

Time spent:
- 72 minutesssz
